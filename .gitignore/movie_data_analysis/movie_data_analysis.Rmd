_Note: This project involves getting data ready for analysis and doing some preliminary investigations. Project 2 will involve modeling and predictions, and will be released at a later date. Both projects will have equal weightage towards your grade._

# Data

In this project, you will explore a dataset that contains information about movies, including ratings, budget, gross revenue and other attributes. It was prepared by Dr. Guy Lebanon, and here is his description of the dataset:

> The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDb’s API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title. This data is available for personal use, but IMDb’s terms of service do not allow it to be used for commercial purposes or for creating a competing repository.

# Objective

Your goal is to investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies, as represented by the variable `Gross`. This task is extremely important as it can help a studio decide which titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for “second window” streaming rights).

# Instructions
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Open this file in RStudio to get started.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
print(x^2)
```

Plots appear inline too:
```{r}
plot(x, x^2, 'o')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Please complete the tasks below and submit this R Markdown file (as **pr1.Rmd**) as well as a PDF export of it (as **pr1.pdf**). Both should contain all the code, output, plots and written responses for each task.

# Setup

## Load data

Make sure you've downloaded the [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) file and it is in the current working directory. Now load it into memory:

```{r}
load('movies_merged')
```

This creates an object of the same name (`movies_merged`). For convenience, you can copy it to `df` and start using it:

```{r}
df = movies_merged
cat("Dataset has", dim(df)[1], "rows and", dim(df)[2], "columns", end="\n", file="")
colnames(df)
```

## Load R packages

Load any R packages that you will need to use. You can come back to this chunk, edit it and re-run to load any additional packages later.

```{r}
library("tokenizers")
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(stringr)
```

If you are loading any non-standard packages (ones that have not been discussed in class or explicitly allowed for this project), please mention them below. Include any special instructions if they cannot be installed using the regular `install.packages('<pkg name>')` command.

**Non-standard packages used**: None

# Tasks

Each task below is worth **10** points, and is meant to be performed sequentially, i.e. do step 2 after you have processed the data as described in step 1. Total points: **100**

Complete each task by implementing code chunks as described by `TODO` comments, and by responding to questions ("**Q**:") with written answers ("**A**:"). If you are unable to find a meaningful or strong relationship in any of the cases when requested, explain why not by referring to appropriate plots/statistics.

It is OK to handle missing values below by omission, but please omit as little as possible. It is worthwhile to invest in reusable and clear code as you may need to use it or modify it in project 2.

## 1. Remove non-movie rows

The variable `Type` captures whether the row is a movie, a TV series, or a game. Remove all rows from `df` that do not correspond to movies.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove all rows from df that do not correspond to movies
df=df[df$Type=="movie",]
nrow(df)
```

**Q**: How many rows are left after removal? _Enter your response below._

**A**: 40000

## 2. Process `Runtime` column

The variable `Runtime` represents the length of the title as a string. Write R code to convert it to a numeric value (in minutes) and replace `df$Runtime` with the new numeric column.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes
# Check the text feature of the Runtime column
unique(str_extract_all(df$Runtime, "[A-z]+"))
```
```{r}
#Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes
for(i in c(1:nrow(df))){
  if(is.na(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[A-z]+"))){
    df[i,"Runtime"]=as.numeric(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[[:digit:]]+"))
  }else if(length(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[A-z]+")[[1]])==2){
    df[i,"Runtime"]=(as.numeric(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[[:digit:]]+")[[1]][1]))*60 +(as.numeric(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[[:digit:]]+")[[1]][2]))
  }else if(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"],"[A-z]+")=="h"){
    df[i,"Runtime"]=(as.numeric(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[[:digit:]]+")))*60
  }else{
    df[i,"Runtime"]=as.numeric(str_extract_all(df[i,"Runtime"], "[[:digit:]]+"))
  }
}
```

```{r}
# Convert the data type of Runtime from character to numeric
df$Runtime=as.numeric(df$Runtime)
```

Now investigate the distribution of `Runtime` values and how it changes over years (variable `Year`, which you can bucket into decades) and in relation to the budget (variable `Budget`). Include any plots that illustrate.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate the distribution of Runtime values and how it varies by Year and Budget
summary(df$Runtime)
```

```{r}
hist(df$Runtime, xlab="Runtime", main="Histogram of Runtime")
```

```{r}
# Subset the original dataset to get a new dataset for the analysis
runtime=df[,c("Year", "Budget", "Runtime")]
```


```{r}
# Get some statistical features of the three columns
min(runtime$Year)
max(runtime$Year)
min(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget), "Budget"])
max(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget), "Budget"])
nrow(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget),])
nrow(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Year),])
# From the dataset, we can discover that
# Budget only contains 4520 valid records
# Year contain 400000 valid records
# Year span is from 1888 to 2017
```

```{r}
# To check the distribution of Runtime over Year and Budget. We need to omit the record with null values
runtime=runtime[!is.na(runtime$Runtime),]
# To fairly compare the Runtime over Year, we need to aggregate the Runtime by Year and Mean
plot(aggregate(runtime[, "Runtime"], list(runtime$Year), mean), type="o")
```

```{r}
# From the plot above, we can discover that there fluctuations over years and there are some years missing
# To get an insight over the general trend of Runtime over Year, we can smooth the data by cut Year into Bins of decades
runtime$Year_bin=cut(runtime$Year, c(1880, seq(1890, 2020, by=10)), dig.lab=0, labels=FALSE, right=FALSE)
# Change the bin Bin number to the start year of that decade
runtime$Year_cut=1880+(runtime$Year_bin-1)*10
# Then aggregate the "Runtime" by decade by mean
aggregate(runtime[, "Runtime"], list(runtime$Year_cut), mean, na.action=na.omit)
```


```{r}
#Display the average Runtime data for the movies in different decades
plot(aggregate(runtime[,"Runtime"], list(runtime$Year_cut), mean), type="o")
#From the plot, we can discover that, in general, Runtime increases over year. Between 1900 to 1920, there is explosion of movie Runtime 
```

```{r}
#Check the distribution of Budget, we can discover that the Budget is right skewed. Most movie cost less than 100 million dollars.
hist(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget), "Budget"], main=paste("Histogram of Budget"), xlab="Budget")
```
```{r}
# For analysis purpose, we use log of Budget instead of Budget because the log of the Budget is more closed to normal distribution
runtime$Budget_log=log10(runtime$Budget)
min(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget_log), "Budget_log"])
max(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget_log), "Budget_log"])
```

```{r}
#We can discover that the log10(Budget) span from 3 to 9
hist(runtime[!is.na(runtime$Budget_log), "Budget_log"], xlab="log10(Budget)", main="Histogram of log10(Budget)")
```

```{r}
# For analysis purpose, we cut the log of Budget into Bins
runtime$Budget_log_bin=cut(runtime$Budget_log, c(3, seq(3.5, 9,by=0.5)), dig.lab=0, labels=FALSE, right=FALSE)
# Then aggregate the Runtime by Budget by Budget log by means
aggregate(runtime[,3], list(runtime$Budget_log_bin*0.5+3), mean)
```



```{r}
plot(aggregate(runtime[,3], list(runtime$Budget_log_bin),mean), type="o", xlab="log10(Budget)", ylab="Runtime")
```

_Feel free to insert additional code chunks as necessary._

**Q**: Comment on the distribution as well as relationships. Are there any patterns or trends that you can observe?

**A**: The distribution of Runtime of movies is close to normal distribution with some outliers. The median is 90 and mean is 81.44. The runtime of movies is centred on an hour and a half.
       After process, there is a obvious positive correlation between Budget and Runtime. As Budget increases, the runtime increases as well.

## 3. Encode `Genre` column

The column `Genre` represents a list of genres associated with the movie in a string format. Write code to parse each text string into a binary vector with 1s representing the presence of a genre and 0s the absence, and add it to the dataframe as additional columns. Then remove the original `Genre` column.

For example, if there are a total of 3 genres: Drama, Comedy, and Action, a movie that is both Action and Comedy should be represented by a binary vector <0, 1, 1>. Note that you need to first compile a dictionary of all possible genres and then figure out which movie has which genres (you can use the R `tm` package to create the dictionary).

```{r}
# TODO: Replace Genre with a collection of binary columns
# We list all of the genres
unique(unlist(tokenize_regex(df$Genre,pattern=", ")))
```

```{r}
#Combine the genre with the original dataset
column_genre_names=unique(unlist(tokenize_regex(df$Genre,pattern=", ")))
genre=data.frame(matrix(nrow=nrow(df), ncol=length(column_genre_names)))
colnames(genre)=column_genre_names
genre[]=0
for(val in column_genre_names){
  genre[grep(val, df[, "Genre"]), val]=1
}
genre_vectored=cbind(df, genre)
```


Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
genre_sum=colSums(genre)
print(genre_sum)
```

```{r}
#Sort the genres based on the number of occurences
genre_sort=sort(genre_sum, decreasing=TRUE)
print(genre_sort)
```

```{r}
#Take the top 10 genres
genre_sort_names=names(genre_sort)
genre_top=genre_sort[1:10]
genre_prop=genre_top/nrow(df)
print(genre_prop)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
pie(genre_prop)
```

Examine how the distribution of `Runtime` changes across genres for the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Runtime distribution for top 10 most common genres
# Create individual data frame for each genre
for(gen in genre_sort_names[1:10]){
  assign(gen, genre_vectored[genre_vectored[, gen]==1,])
}

# Create histogram for each genre and display their runtime distribution
for( gen in genre_sort_names[1:10]){
  hist(get(gen)[!is.na(get(gen)$Runtime), "Runtime"], main=paste("Histogram of", gen, "Runtime"), xlab="Runtime")
    

}
```

**Q**: Describe the interesting relationship(s) you observe. Are there any expected or unexpected trends that are evident?

**A**: For most of genre, runtime has a normal-like distribution 
       Expected: Most of genre have a distribution close to normal distribution. 
       Unexpected: Comedy and Animation has a distribution showing a strong skewness. 

## 4. Eliminate mismatched rows

The dataframe was put together by merging two different sources of data and it is possible that the merging process was inaccurate in some cases (the merge was done based on movie title, but there are cases of different movies with the same title). The first source’s release time was represented by the column `Year` (numeric representation of the year) and the second by the column `Released` (string representation of release date).

Find and remove all rows where you suspect a merge error occurred based on a mismatch between these two variables. To make sure subsequent analysis and modeling work well, avoid removing more than 10% of the rows that have a `Gross` value present.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove rows with Released-Year mismatch
# omit NA rows
test=df[setdiff(rownames(df), rownames(df[is.na(df$Released),])),]
test_match=test[abs((test$Year-as.numeric(substr(test$Released, 1, 4))))<=1,]
test_dismatch=df[setdiff(rownames(df), rownames(df[rownames(test_match),])),]

```

```{r}
#Count the records with Gross value in matched records and dismatched records to ensure the "less than 10% removement" requirement is met
nrow(test_match[!is.na(test_match$Gross), ])
nrow(test_dismatch[!is.na(test_dismatch$Gross),])
nrow(test_dismatch[!is.na(test_dismatch$Gross),])/nrow(test_match[!is.na(test_match$Gross), ])

```

**Q**: What is your precise removal logic and how many rows did you end up removing?

**A**: At first, we exclude the records with missing Released column, then we do the calculation of the difference between "Year" column and "Released" column. Then we exclude the records which the difference of "Year" column and the "Released" column is bigger than 1.

## 5. Explore `Gross` revenue

For the commercial success of a movie, production houses want to maximize Gross revenue. Investigate if Gross revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre in any way.

Note: To get a meaningful relationship, you may have to partition the movies into subsets such as short vs. long duration, or by genre, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre
g_revenue=df[!is.na(df$Gross),]
g_revenue=g_revenue[!is.na(g_revenue$Budget),]

```

```{r}
g_revenue$Budget_log=log10(g_revenue$Budget)
g_revenue$Budget_log_bin=cut(g_revenue$Budget_log, c(3, seq(3.5, 9, by=0.5)), dig.lab=0, labels=FALSE,right=FALSE)
g_revenue_agg=aggregate(g_revenue[,"Gross"], list(g_revenue$Budget_log_bin*0.5+3), mean)
g_revenue_agg$Gross_log=log2(g_revenue_agg[,2])
print(g_revenue_agg)
```

```{r}
plot(g_revenue_agg[,c(1,3)], type="o", xlab="log(Budget)", ylab="log(Gross)")
```

**Q**: Did you find any observable relationships or combinations of Budget/Runtime/Genre that result in high Gross revenue? If you divided the movies into different subsets, you may get different answers for them - point out interesting ones.

**A**: We can discover there is a positive correlation between the Budget and Gross value

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Release Month
# Retrieve the month from the "Released" column
g_revenue$month=substr(g_revenue$Released, 6, 7)
# Aggregate the Gross by month, we can discover the movies are much more successful in summer and Year End
plot(aggregate(g_revenue$Gross, list(g_revenue$month), mean), type="o", xlab="Month", ylab="Gross")
```

## 6. Process `Awards` column

The variable `Awards` describes nominations and awards in text format. Convert it to 2 numeric columns, the first capturing the number of wins, and the second capturing nominations. Replace the `Awards` column with these new columns, and then study the relationship of `Gross` revenue with respect to them.

Note that the format of the `Awards` column is not standard; you may have to use regular expressions to find the relevant values. Try your best to process them, and you may leave the ones that don't have enough information as NAs or set them to 0s.

```{r}
# TODO: Convert Awards to 2 numeric columns: wins and nominations
# Process the "Awards" column and fill in the "wins" and "nominations" columns
for (i in c(1:nrow(df))){
    win=0
    nomination=0
  if(grepl("Won",df[i, "Awards"])){
    win=as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "Won ([\\d]+)"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
    win=win+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) win"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
    nomination=nomination+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) nomination"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
  }else if(grepl("Nominated",df[i, "Awards"])){
    nomination=as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "Nominated for ([\\d]+)"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
    win=win+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) win"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
    nomination=nomination+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) nomination"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
  }else{
    win=win+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) win"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
    nomination=nomination+as.numeric(str_extract(str_extract(df[i,"Awards"], "([\\d]+) nomination"), "[[:digit:]]+"))
  }
    df[i,"wins"]=win
    df[i, "nominations"]=nomination
    if(is.na(df[i,"wins"])){df[i,"wins"]=0}
    if(is.na(df[i,"nominations"])){df[i,"nominations"]=0}
}


```



**Q**: How did you construct your conversion mechanism? How many rows had valid/non-zero wins or nominations?

**A**: 1. If the records contains the word "Won", then take the number and add it to the variable "win". Then check the number after the word "win", add it to the variable "win". Then check the number after the word "nomination", add it to the variable "nomination".
       2. Else if the record contains the word "Nominated", then take the number and add it to the variable "nomination". Then check the number after the word "win", add it to the variable "win". Then check the number after the word "nomination", add it to the variable "nomination"
       3. Else Then check the number after the word "win", add it to the variable "win". Then check the number after the word "nomination", add it to the variable "nomination"
       4. Set rest as 0
      

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Gross revenue against wins and nominations
gross_awards=df[!is.na(df$Gross),]
aggregate(gross_awards[,"Gross"], list(gross_awards[,"wins"]), mean)

```

```{r}
plot(aggregate(gross_awards[,"Gross"], list(gross_awards[,"wins"]), mean), type="o", xlab="Wins", ylab="Gross")
```

```{r}
aggregate(gross_awards[,"Gross"], list(gross_awards[,"nominations"]), mean)
```

```{r}
plot(aggregate(gross_awards[,"Gross"], list(gross_awards[,"nominations"]), mean), type="o", xlab="Nominations", ylab="Gross")
```

**Q**: How does the gross revenue vary by number of awards won and nominations received?

**A**: We can discover that movies with nomination and wins around 70 to 150 have highest Gross revenue. As nomination and wins decreases or increases from this range, the Gross revenue decreases.

## 7. Movie ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes

There are several variables that describe ratings, including IMDb ratings (`imdbRating` represents average user ratings and `imdbVotes` represents the number of user ratings), and multiple Rotten Tomatoes ratings (represented by several variables pre-fixed by `tomato`). Read up on such ratings on the web (for example [rottentomatoes.com/about](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about) and [ www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq](http:// www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq)).

Investigate the pairwise relationships between these different descriptors using graphs.

```{r}
# TODO: Illustrate how ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes are related
pairs(df[,c("imdbRating", "imdbVotes", "tomatoMeter", "tomatoRating","tomatoReviews" , "tomatoFresh"       ,"tomatoRotten" ,"tomatoUserMeter" , "tomatoUserRating","tomatoUserReviews")])
```



**Q**: Comment on the similarities and differences between the user ratings of IMDb and the critics ratings of Rotten Tomatoes.

**A**: IMDB ratings does not have a strong self correlation, however, tomato rating shows a very strong self correlations. For example, TomatoReviews almost form a linear relationship with TomatoFresh.
       Similarities: IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes all centralized over a range of rating scores. 
       Diffirences: There are some Rotten Tomatoes ratings which distributed over two polar, like TomotoUserReviews.

## 8. Ratings and awards

These ratings typically reflect the general appeal of the movie to the public or gather opinions from a larger body of critics. Whereas awards are given by professional societies that may evaluate a movie on specific attributes, such as artistic performance, screenplay, sound design, etc.

Study the relationship between ratings and awards using graphs (awards here refers to wins and/or nominations). 

```{r}
# TODO: Show how ratings and awards are related
# Create individual data frame for each rating
ratings=c("imdbRating", "imdbVotes", "tomatoMeter", "tomatoRating","tomatoReviews" , "tomatoFresh"       ,"tomatoRotten" ,"tomatoUserMeter" , "tomatoUserRating","tomatoUserReviews")
for(rating in ratings){
  assign(rating, df[!is.na(df[,rating]),c(rating, "wins","nominations")])
}

```

```{r}

# For each rating, display their distribution over wins and nominations
for(rating in ratings){
  plot(aggregate(get(rating)[,rating], list(get(rating)[,"wins"]), mean), type="o", xlab="wins", ylab=rating)
  plot(aggregate(get(rating)[,rating], list(get(rating)[,"nominations"]), mean), type="o", xlab="nominations", ylab=rating)  

}
```

**Q**: How good are these ratings in terms of predicting the success of a movie in winning awards or nominations? Is there a high correlation between two variables?

**A**: We can find that, except "tomatoUserReviews" and "tomatoRotten", all of other reviews has a strong positive correlation between wins/nominations and review scores.

## 9. Expected insights

Come up with two new insights (backed up by data and graphs) that is expected. Here “new” means insights that are not an immediate consequence of one of the above tasks. You may use any of the columns already explored above or a different one in the dataset, such as `Title`, `Actors`, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate two expected insights


unique(unlist(tokenize_regex(df$Country,pattern=", ")))
```

```{r}
#Combine the genre with the original dataset
column_country_names=unique(unlist(tokenize_regex(df$Country,pattern=", ")))
country=data.frame(matrix(nrow=nrow(df), ncol=length(column_country_names)))
colnames(country)=column_country_names
country[]=0
for(val in column_country_names){
  country[grep(val, df[, "Country"]), val]=1
}
```


Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
country_sum=colSums(country)
#Sort the genres based on the number of occurences
country_sort=sort(country_sum, decreasing=TRUE)
print(country_sort)
```


```{r}
#Calculate the percentage of movies by country
country_top=country_sort[1:20]
country_prop=country_top/nrow(df)
print(country_prop)
```

```{r}
#Plot the number by pie chart
pie(country_prop)
```

```{r}
#Take the USA out and replot the data
pie(country_sort[2:20]/nrow(df))
```

**Q**: Expected insight #1.

**A**: Since USA has the biggest movie industry in the world, it is very normal to see that over half of the movies was produced by USA.


**Q**: Expected insight #2.

**A**: With few exceptions, movies all come from developed countries. Since movie industry requires a lot of investment, it is normal to see the absence of developing countries and under-developed countries.


## 10. Unexpected insight

Come up with one new insight (backed up by data and graphs) that is unexpected at first glance and do your best to motivate it. Same instructions apply as the previous task.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate one unexpected insight
# To investigate the relationship between gross revenue and countries
country_gross=cbind(df[, c("Gross", "Domestic_Gross", "Budget")], country)
# Calculate the the percentage of domestic gross over overall gross
country_gross$gross_perc=country_gross$Domestic_Gross/country_gross$Gross

```

```{r}
# Split the dataset into domestic market and international market based on gross percentage
domestic_market=country_gross[!is.na(country_gross$gross_perc),]
domestic_market=domestic_market[domestic_market$gross_perc>0.5,]
international_market=country_gross[!is.na(country_gross$gross_perc),]
international_market=international_market[international_market$gross_perc<=0.5,]
```

```{r}
domestic_market=domestic_market[, !(names(domestic_market) %in% c("Gross", "Domestic_Gross", "Budget", "gross_perc"))]
international_market=international_market[, !(names(international_market) %in% c("Gross", "Domestic_Gross", "Budget", "gross_perc"))]
